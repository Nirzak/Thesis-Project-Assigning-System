# Project-Distribution-G28
SUST CSE Thesis/Project Assigning System is an online system to assign desired thesis/projects to student and also assign supervisors with student groups.

## Motivation:
Previously, the project/thesis was distributed manually to the students. The students have to fill up a form with their course results and give a choice list of supervisors according to their preference for their topic/domain. The students have to contact the teachers with whom they want to do their thesis/project. The supervisor has to know the student's profile to allow him/her.

In fact, doing this is very time-consuming and we know that a supervisor has too many things to do. So we are thinking of making a web platform which will help in this regard. Through this website, the students will learn about their teacher, their thesis and projects. And they can give their choice list easily. On the other hand, the honourable teachers can also see the student profiles, projects, thesis and the domain in which they previously worked. This information about the student will help the supervisor choose the student. To make everything easier, we thought of making a website regarding student profiles, supervisor profiles, student results, and finally, the admin can assign thesis/project to the student.

## Functionalities:
1. Student/Admin seperate login and dashboard
2. Options to submit Supervisors choice list with Thesis/Project proposal.
3. Admin can assign supervisors to student.
4. Admin crus functionalities to manage applications, students and supervisors.
5. Separate page to show profile of each supervisor and their works.
6. Application status page to show the status of current submitted application.
